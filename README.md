# FinWise GenAI Capstone: Intelligent Banking Assistant
A full-stack GenAI project integrating LangChain, Gemini Pro, and AI automation workflows to build a suite of intelligent banking tools — from chatbots and document Q&A to SQL agents, summarizers, and workflow automation.
### Project Overview

The FinWise GenAI Capstone explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can power next-generation financial assistants capable of:

- Understanding user intent through natural language

- Retaining context across conversations

- Retrieving and reasoning over structured and unstructured data

- Automating tasks via tool access and external APIs

- Summarizing and monitoring banking data pipelines

This end-to-end system demonstrates how GenAI can modernize banking operations — from customer chat to compliance intelligence.

### Key Learnings

- Building context-aware LLM systems using LangChain Memory

- Implementing tool-augmented agents with reasoning graphs

- Developing retrieval-augmented pipelines for enterprise documents

- Creating end-to-end AI workflows using n8n automation

### Conclusion

The FinWise GenAI Capstone showcases how AI can transform digital banking experiences — blending retrieval, reasoning, and automation into one intelligent ecosystem.
This modular architecture can scale to enterprise-level financial AI platforms, from customer support to risk analytics and compliance automation.
